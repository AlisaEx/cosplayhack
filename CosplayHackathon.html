              <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
              <h2 class="collapser"><i class="icon-caret-down"></i> What is a hackathon?</h2>
              <p class="collapsible collapse in">
                A hackathon is an event that brings together engineers, programmers, designers, seamstresses; anyone with good ideas into the same space for a brief but intense period of collaboration to create ... something.
              </p>
              <h2 class="collapser"><i class="icon-caret-down"></i> What is a COSPLAY hackathon?</h2>
              <p class="collapsible collapse">
                A Cosplay Hackathon is an event aimed combining electronics and cosplaying to create amazing costumes. You will be given a secret ingredient and $20 to spend at thrift stores. Given the tools and supplies at Heatsync Labs, you will have 2 full days to create a costume for presentation at the Masquerade Sunday night.
              </p>
              <h2 class="collapser"><i class="icon-caret-right"></i> What are the rules?</h2>
              <p class="collapsible collapse">
                You may only shop at thrift stores. The main rule will be budgets so the competition doesn't become a quest to find the deepest pockets. Only $20 will be allotted for thrift stores. The cost of a wig will be excluded. You may also use any of the tools and supplies on hand at Heatsync.
                Your secret ingredient must be implemented and highlighted in your costume or prop, however feel free to do so creatively (that's kind of the point). 
                Judges will be on hand if you'd like to clear something through them. That being said there will be a Jury prize too so breaking the rules may be worth it.  :D
              </p>
              <h2 class="collapser"><i class="icon-caret-right"></i> Who can participate?</h2>
              <p class="collapsible collapse">
                Anyone enthusiastic about cosplaying, electronics, sewing, making, prop building, hacking, collaborating and enjoying a little bit of competition. Some sewing or prop building knowledge would be helpful, but we'll have experts on staff to answer any questions.
              </p>
              <h2 class="collapser"><i class="icon-caret-right"></i> Do I need a team or idea to sign up?</h2>
              <p class="collapsible collapse">
                Nope. We will hold a morning session to help people connect and meet other people. As for ideas you'll only find out the secret ingredients on hack day and will have to work from there.
              </p>
              <h2 class="collapser"><i class="icon-caret-right"></i> May we sign up as a team?</h2>
              <p class="collapsible collapse">
                Sign up is done on an individual basis. There will be 2 seperate categories, electronics and cosplay. Each team will consist of one electronics and two sewing/props hackers.
              </p>
              <h2 class="collapser"><i class="icon-caret-right"></i> What should I bring?</h2>
              <p class="collapsible collapse">
                Anything you think you might need. A sewing machine. Your own wigs. Extra fabric. A soldering gun. Everything and anything you feel would help you during the hackathon.
              </p>
              <h2 class="collapser"><i class="icon-caret-right"></i> How long is the hackathon?</h2>
              <p class="collapsible collapse">
                The hackathon will run over a 72 hour period, starting Friday and ending Sunday. Saturday is a lax day and teams are free to meet up at Heatsync or at their houses to work on their project. We will be onsite at least 12 hours including the intro session and presentations/judging.
              </p>
              <h2 class="collapser"><i class="icon-caret-right"></i> Do I have to be at the hackathon the entire time?</h2>
              <p class="collapsible collapse">
                Nope. We actually recommend that people take breaks from their work to stretch and get refreshed, shop, sleep, etc. However Friday and Sunday, you need to be at Heatsync Labs for the opening ceremony Friday night and the Masquerade Sunday night.
              </p>
              <h2 class="collapser"><i class="icon-caret-right"></i> Can I bring my husband/wife/kids?</h2>
              <p class="collapsible collapse">
                If they are signed up and competing, yes, otherwise no. Space and tools will be very limited.
              </p>
              <h2 class="collapser"><i class="icon-caret-right"></i> Is food provided?</h2>
              <p class="collapsible collapse">
                Yup! We will be providing lunch, dinner, snacks and maybe even energy drinks throughout the competition free of charge. If you have a special dietary need (gluten-free, vegetarian, etc) or food allergy - please <a href="mailto:info@hackPHX.com">email</a> us! We will be more than happy to work with you.
              </p>
